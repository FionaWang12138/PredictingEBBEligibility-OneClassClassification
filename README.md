Create for the TracHack challenge, which required participants to make predictions on the eligibility of customers for the Emergency Broadband Benifits (EBB) program. Positive unlabeled data were given, which presented a one-class classification problem. Data processing was performed after the initial data analysis. Four machine learning models were explored and fine-tuned through hyper-parameter tuning and features selection. Modified Logistic Regression was chosen as the final model due to its high performance, and an F1 score of 0.96. The performance of all models were analysed, and possible improvements were stated for future exploration.
